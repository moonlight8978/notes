title: AWS Simple Storage Service
code: N/A

#### Overview

- Object-based, serverless storage service
- Object-based storage: 
  - Storage that manages data as objects
  - Other architectures:
    - File system: manage data as files and file hierarchy
    - Block storage: manage data as blocks within sectors and tracks
- Unlimited storage
- S3 object:
  - Contains:
    - Key
    - Value: the value itself made up of a sequence of bytes
    - Version ID
    - Metadata
  - Size: 0B - 5TB
- S3 bucket:
  - Hold objects, can have folders too
  - Bucket name is universal

#### S3 Classes

* Trade Retrieval Time, Accessibility, Durability for cheaper storage

| Tier                         | Features                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standard                     | Fast. 99.99% Availability. 11 9's Durability. Replicated across at least 3 AZs |
| Intelligence                 | Data is moved to the most cost-effective tier without impact to performance, overhead. Using ML |
| Standard Infrequently Access | Still Fast. Cheaper if access < 1 time / month, or additional retrieval fees applied. Overall -50% than Standard |
| One Zone IA                  | Still Fast. 1 AZ. 99.5% Availability. Data could be destroyed. Retrieval fee is applied. 20% Cheaper than Standard IA |
| Glacier                      | Long-term cold storage. Retrieval time can take a minute to hours. >=3 AZs |
| Glacier Deep Archive         | Data retrieval time is 12 hours                              |

* All 11 9's Durability

#### Security

* Private by default
* Logging can be enabled, and stored in another bucket
* Access control is configured using ACL (legacy but not deprecated) and Bucket Policies (IAM)

#### Encryption

* Transit: SSL
* Encrypted at rest

#### Data consistency

* New object: consistent - we can read right after writing

* Overwrite, Delete: it takes time to replicate over AZs. 

  => If we read data immediately, old data can be returned - Inconsistent

  => Should wait a few seconds

#### Cross region replication (CRR)

* When enabled, objects are replicated automatically
* Higher availability, durability
* Versioning must be turned on (on both buckets)
* Replication rule:
  * Apply for new creation object or not
  * IAM (grant permissions for buckets)
* Replicating existing objects requires contacting to AWS Support

 #### Versioning

* Once enabled, it can be suspended only.
* Store all versions of objects in S3 

#### Life cycle management

* Automate the process of moving objects to another storage class, and deleting objects
* Can be used with versioning, can be applied to both current and previous versions

#### Transfer Acceleration

* Fast & secure transfer objects to end users, utilizes CloudFront's edge location

* Upload to Edge Location's distinct URL instead of uploading to S3 directly.

  Edge location route the file to S3 using AWS backbone network (optimized)

#### Presigned URL

* Generate URL to grant temporary access (get or put) to private objects

#### MFA Delete

* Versioning must be enabled
* AWS CLI must be used to turn on MFA
* Only the bucket owner login as root user can delete objects from the bucket
